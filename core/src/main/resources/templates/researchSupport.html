                <p>The program you’re completing is a type of intervention called Cognitive Bias Modification, and it is
                    designed to change how you think in response to situations that make you feel anxious or upset.</p>
                <p>Cognitive biases are tendencies to pay attention to, remember, and interpret things differently when
                    processing information tied to your emotional responses. For example, sometimes it’s difficult to
                    tell whether something that happens is good or bad. Our tendency to interpret these ambiguous events
                    as positive or negative can happen very rapidly and even without us being aware of our
                    interpretation, so it can be difficult to catch these thinking habits, even though a tendency to
                    routinely interpret things in negative ways can make us feel more anxious or sad. That’s where
                    cognitive bias modification might help.</p>
                <p>Cognitive Bias Modification works by giving people lots of practice processing information in new ways
                    to help develop healthier thinking habits. These tasks may seem repetitive, and it is not always
                    obvious what the program is doing. However, there is growing evidence that Cognitive Bias
                    Modification can be an effective method for reducing negative feelings, like anxiety and sadness.</p>
                 <p>Several research studies have shown that Cognitive Bias Modification is effective at changing
                     interpretations in people with clinical levels of anxiety. Further, many studies have found that
                     Cognitive Bias Modification leads to decreases in anxiety symptoms and/or anxious reactions to
                     potentially stressful situations, compared to control conditions (often referred to as placebo; a
                     control condition may look like the active training but is not expected to work as well at encouraging healthier thinking habits).
                 </p>
                <p>Now, you may have some concerns about being placed in a "placebo condition."  In our study, every participant
                    will have a chance to experience the conditions that proves best.</p>
                <p>There is also research evidence that repeated training sessions can be especially beneficial, because
                    it provides more opportunities to practice healthier ways of thinking than a single training
                    session. This is why we set up eight brief sessions of training.</p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, there is research showing how biases in imagery are closely connected to difficulties with anxiety,
                    which is why participants complete imagery exercises as part of the program.
                </p>
                <p>Although there are many examples of Cognitive Bias Modification programs helping to reduce anxiety,
                    and even helping other problem areas like depression, substance use (e.g., alcohol abuse), eating
                    disorders, and anger problems (among others), there are also some mixed findings. Not all studies
                    using these approaches get the same results, and some studies find decreases in one anxiety measure
                    but not another. Also, more research needs to be done comparing different numbers of training
                    sessions to try to find the optimum number, and testing how to make the results for Cognitive Bias
                    Modification done online as strong as results for the program done in the clinic or lab. Though there are
                    still questions that need to be answered, one goal of this site is to work on answering these
                    questions in order to refine and improve this promising treatment method.</p>
