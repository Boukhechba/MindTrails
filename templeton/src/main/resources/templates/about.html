                <p> Thank you for your interest in our research! </p>

                <p>Future Thinking includes 4 sessions that are spread out over 2-3 weeks. You’ll complete
                    2–3 training and/or imagery sessions each week, and each session requires about 20 minutes to complete.
                    You will be randomly assigned to different conditions, because we are trying to figure out exactly what
                    kind of training works best.  Depending on your assignment, some trainings may be faster than others.
                    You’ll also complete some assessments as part of our research study so that we can evaluate how well the program works.
                    At the end of the study, we’ll give you feedback about how your symptoms have changed over the course of the program.</p>

                <p>You can do the sessions anywhere, so long as you have access to a quiet place and a computer with Internet.
                    This program is free and can be completed without ever leaving your desk.</p>

                <h3>So, how does MindTrails work? </h3>

                <p>In our program, we are attempting to help you change the way you think about common but potentially
                    stressful situations in order to reduce your anxiety. During each session, you will be asked to do an imagery exercise and, in some cases,
                    read brief stories and complete word fragments, by filling in one or more missing letters in a word. The
                    task is not meant to be tricky or too difficult. It is not a puzzle to try to solve.</p>

                <p>These exercises are designed to help you change the way you make sense of emotional events by giving
                    you lots of practice in responding to them in different ways. The program can feel a little repetitive,
                    but the repetition is important so you develop a new interpretation style.</p>

                <p>Don’t worry if you don’t use computers much—the tasks are not designed to be difficult and you can always
                    email us with questions at <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org.</a></p>

                <p><b>This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research suggests this
                    program may be able to reduce anxiety as effectively as therapy for some people. We want to determine if
                    it can be helpful for you.  If you would like to learn more about the science behind MindTrails, take a look
                    at the "Research Support" button at the top of the page.</b></p>
