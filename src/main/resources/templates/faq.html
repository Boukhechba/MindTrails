                <h2> General questions </h2>
                    <h3>1. How can I make sure I get the main training condition?</h3>

                    <p>a. Everyone will be randomly assigned to one of the various conditions being
                        tested—you cannot choose which you are assigned to. This is necessary so the researchers can
                        scientifically test how well each condition works. At the end of the study, you will be notified
                        of your assignment. If you were assigned to a condition that we do not think will be the
                        strongest one, you will then have the opportunity to complete the condition we expect to be most
                        effective. </p>

                    <!---->
                    <h3>2. I’ve completed a few sessions and am still feeling anxious. Is the program not working for
                        me?</h3>

                    <p>a. Don’t give up! Even individuals assigned to the main condition may not notice changes
                        right away. People in the other conditions may also not notice any changes, though
                        this varies by person. It is important to keep completing the sessions as assigned and to honestly
                        and accurately report your feelings throughout the program. You are helping us learn what works. </p>

                    <h3>3. What if I miss a session? Can I do three the following week?</h3>

                    <p>a. Try to complete the sessions based on the schedule we give you. We will send you email
                        reminders to help you remember when you should complete your next session. If you miss a
                        session, complete it as soon as you have time (though we ask you to always leave at least one
                        day between sessions).</p>

                    <h3>4. Where and when can I do the sessions?</h3>

                    <p>a. You can complete this program wherever and whenever you would like, as long as you have access
                        to a computer and Internet connection. We strongly recommend that you complete the tasks when
                        you are in a reasonably quiet place and able to devote your full attention to them.</p>

                    <!---->
                    <h3>5. I have limited computer skills. Can I still use this program?</h3>

                    <p>a. Yes. Anyone with access to the Internet and an email address is welcome to use this site.
                        Assessments (questionnaires) are simple and easy to complete; most are point-and-click. Other
                        tasks will ask you to type letters on your keyboard. Throughout the study, we will send you
                        emails to update you on your progress and to remind you of upcoming tasks. You can also email us
                        if you have any questions. Email: <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">
                                                             studyteam@mindtrails.org</a></p>

                    <h3>6. Who created this program?</h3>

                    <p>a. Researchers from the University of Virginia created these programs, but they were adapted from
                        evidence-based computer tasks that have typically been tested in research laboratories (Hallion and Ruscio, 2011) .As
                        clinical scientists, we are interested in evaluating how well the programs work outside of the
                        research lab. In the long run, we are interested in creating a cost-effective and accessible mental
                        health treatment.</p>

                    <h3>7. Is this really going to work for my anxiety?</h3>

                    <p>a. This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but some prior research
                        indicates it may be able to reduce anxiety. Even if you get assigned to a condition that we do not expect to be effective,
                        you will be given the opportunity to complete the training condition that we expect to be most
                        effective after you finish the study.</p>

                    <h3>8. I’m already receiving treatment for my anxiety (e.g., prescriptions or seeing a therapist).
                        Can I still use this program?</h3>

                    <p>a. Yes; anyone that qualifies is welcome to use this program. Before you begin, you will be asked
                        a series of questions about your mental health. Please let us know that you are already
                        receiving treatment, but you can still participate in this study.</p>

                    <h3>9. Can I do the program from my phone or tablet?</h3>

                    <p>a. No. The program is not optimized for use on a smartphone, tablet, or PDA (e.g., using mobile
                        operating systems such as Android or iOS). Please complete all sessions from a desktop, laptop,
                        or netbook computer. The following browsers are supported: Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome,
                        and Firefox.</p>

                    <h3>10. What if I will be out of town, and without access to a computer, during the study?</h3>

                    <p>a. If you miss a session, complete it as soon as you have time. Also, please let us know if you
                        will be away for more than a week, or we may assume you are no longer interested in
                        participating in the study.</p>

                    <h2>Specific questions about your experience with the program</h2>

                    <h3>1. When answering questions (following each of the brief stories), the program keeps telling me
                        that my answer is incorrect.</h3>

                    <p>a. Please answer the questions based on information given to you in the stories. Remember that it
                        is essential that you fully involve yourself as if the events described are really happening to
                        you, so your answers should reflect that.</p>

                    <h3>2. When trying to complete word fragments at the end of the brief stories, the program keeps
                        telling me my answer is incorrect.</h3>

                    <p>a. Please complete the word fragments based only on information given to you in the brief
                        stories.</p>
