                        <p>
                            Please think of an upcoming situation that is routine (i.e., that happens regularly) and does not particularly concern you or make you feel especially happy, worried, sad, etc. For instance, the situation could involve brushing your teeth, taking a shower, surfing the web, watching TV, getting dressed, or checking your email. Pick a situation that you wonâ€™t worry or get excited about; the situation should be so mundane and routine you will hardly give it any thought. Any situation that you have no strong feelings toward will work. If no specific situation is upcoming, then just select a situation that you expect would generate little emotion IF you were in that situation.
