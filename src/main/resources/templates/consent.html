    <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, experimental anxiety reduction program. It includes
        eight 20-minute training sessions, over the course of 3-4 weeks (2-3 sessions per week), and five
        20-minute assessment sessions.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You may be presented with one of the experimental anxiety reduction programs. Alternatively, you
        may be asked to complete “control” programs, which are tasks that are similar to the experimental
        anxiety reduction programs, but not designed to reduce anxiety. This is to test whether or not the
        experimental programs are really working. If you get assigned to a control program, you will be given
        the opportunity to complete a real experimental program after you finish the study. In other words,
        EVERYBODY gets a chance to try our program eventually.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You will be asked to complete a 20-minute assessment before your 1st training session, after your 3rd
        training session, after your 6th training session, after your 8th training session, and 2 months after
        your 8th training session. The assessments will help us track your progress and determine if this new
        program is effective.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You will be compensated with a $5 gift card for each 20-minute assessment (via email from Tango
        where you can choose from top name-brands like Amazon.com, Starbucks, iTunes, Target and
        many more, or you can donate the value to a charity). You can receive a total of $25 in gift cards by
        completing all five assessments. If you complete the final assessment, you’ll also receive a T-shirt.</p>
    <br />
    <p>You will be asked to complete questionnaires in which you describe your thoughts and mood, describe
        your background and personal mental health history, and a task in which you read brief stories,
        answer questions, and complete word fragments. For some participants, being asked questions about
        their thoughts and mood can be temporarily distressing.</p>
    <br />
    <p>At the end of the study, you will receive more detail about the study’s rationale and design. You will
        also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There may be no direct benefits to you. Depending on your randomly assigned condition, you may
        complete procedures that may help reduce symptoms of anxiety. If you are assigned to a control
        condition, you will be given the option to complete one of the experimental anxiety reduction
        conditions after the study is complete.</p>
