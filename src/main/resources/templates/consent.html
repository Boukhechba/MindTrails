                            <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, experimental anxiety reduction program. It
                                includes
                                eight 20-minute training sessions, over the course of 3-4 weeks (2-3 sessions per week), and
                                five
                                20-minute assessment sessions.</p>
                            <br/>

                            <p>You will be presented with one of a few different training programs. We are testing whether
                                one of them is more effective in reducing anxiety than alternative methods. Although our
                                prediction of which program will be most effective is based on previous work in the laboratory,
                                we cannot be sure until the programs are compared by randomly assigning people to each one
                                and then testing the effects. If you get randomly assigned to a program that we do not think
                                will be the strongest one, you will then have the opportunity to complete the program we
                                expect to be most effective after you finish the study. In other words, EVERYBODY gets a
                                chance to try program we expect to be most effective eventually.</p>

                            <br/>

                            <p>You will be asked to complete a 20-minute assessment before your 1st training session, after your
                                3rd
                                training session, after your 6th training session, after your 8th training session, and 2 months
                                after
                                your 8th training session. The assessments will help us track your progress and determine if
                                this new
                                program is effective.</p>
                            <br/>

                            <p>You will be compensated with a $5 gift card for each 20-minute assessment (via email from Tango
                                where you can choose from top name-brands like Amazon.com, Starbucks, iTunes, Target and
                                many more, or you can donate the value to a charity). You can receive a total of $25 in gift
                                cards by
                                completing all five assessments. If you complete the final assessment, you’ll also receive a
                                a bonus $10 gift card.</p>
                            <br/>

                            <p>You will be asked to complete questionnaires in which you describe your thoughts and mood,
                                describe
                                your background and personal mental health history, and a task in which you read brief stories,
                                answer questions, and complete word fragments. For some participants, being asked questions
                                about
                                their thoughts and mood can be temporarily distressing.</p>
                            <br/>

                            <p>At the end of the study, you will receive more detail about the study’s rationale and design. You
                                will
                                also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program and how your anxiety symptoms changed.</p>
                            <br/>

                            <p>There may be no direct benefits to you. Depending on your randomly assigned condition, you may
                                complete procedures that may help reduce symptoms of anxiety.</p>
