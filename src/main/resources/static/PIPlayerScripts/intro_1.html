    <p>In training, you will read a series of short stories.</p>
    <h3>For each story:</h3>
    <ul>
      <br />
        <li>Read each sentence carefully and <i>really imagine</i>
            yourself in the situation described.
        </li>
        <li>Even if the story describes you reacting in a way
            that you would not usually react, please try to
            picture yourself responding in the way the story
            describes.
        </li>
        <li>There will be an incomplete word at the end of
            each paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>Press the key or keys on the keyboard that
            completes the word. Research suggests that filling in the missing
            letter(s) to complete the word helps you to really think about the
            meaning of the story.
        </li>
        <li>When you correctly complete the word you
            will move on to the next screen and be asked a
            question about the story. To answer this question, <u>only use the
            information from the story</u> – we’re not asking for your personal
            opinion to answer the question, we just want you to think about what
             happened in the story.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Press the <b>Space Bar</b> to continue.</p>
