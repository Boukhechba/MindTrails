    <li>When you correctly complete the word you
          will move on to the next screen and be asked a
          question about the story. <u>Use only the
          information from the story to answer this question</u> – we’re not asking for your personal
          opinion, we just want you to think about what
           happened in the story.
    </li>

    <li>Note, we ask you to do the full training session in one sitting. This typically takes approximately 15 minutes.
            If you exit the program partway through the training session, you will be asked to start that day’s training
            session over again. Of course it’s no problem if you need to take a break – please just don’t close your
            browser window. Thanks!</li>
