    <h3>For each story:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read the paragraph carefully and really imagine
            yourself in the situation described.
        </li>
        <li>Even if the story describes you reacting in a way
            that you would not really react, please try to
            picture yourself responding in the way the story
            describes.
        </li>
        <li>There will be an incomplete word at the end of
            each paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>Press the key or keys on the keyboard that
            complete the word.
        </li>
